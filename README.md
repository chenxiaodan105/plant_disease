# plant_disease
deep learning project for images classification
Plant diseases are major threats for smallholder farmers, who depend on healthy crops to survive, and about 80% of the agricultural production in the developing world is generated by them. Identifying a disease correctly when it first appears is a crucial step for efficient disease management and agricultural production. Our objective of this project is to design algorithms and models to recognize species and disease in the crop leaves.
